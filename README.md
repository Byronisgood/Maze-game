# Maze Game

## Project Status: In Progress

Welcome to the Maze Game project! Embark on an exciting adventure where players navigate through a maze, collecting carrots to win the game. The game is designed with a starting point, a goal, and obstacles (spikes) to avoid, providing a captivating and challenging experience.

### Gameplay Overview

In the Maze Game, your objective is to guide the player through various levels by collecting carrots scattered throughout the maze. Each level presents a unique challenge, and as you successfully navigate through the maze, collecting carrots along the way, you'll unlock the path to the next level.

- **Collect Carrots to Win:** The primary goal is to gather all the carrots within the maze to advance to the next level.

- **Obstacles to Avoid (Spikes):** Beware of spikes strategically placed within the maze. These spikes serve as obstacles that must be avoided to prevent hindrances to your progress. Colliding with a spike will present a challenge and may affect your ability to collect carrots.

- **Game End Screen:** Successfully navigate through all the levels, avoiding obstacles and collecting carrots along the way. Your triumph in the Maze Game will be celebrated with a captivating game end screen.

### Known Issues

As we continue developing the game, we're aware of the following challenges:

- **Continuous Levels:** The current version does not seamlessly transition between levels. We're actively working on implementing a more engaging and continuous level progression.

- **Obstacle Interaction:** Presently, the game doesn't handle obstacles in a way that triggers an end condition. Even if you hit an obstacle (spike), the game continues. We're refining obstacle interactions for a more immersive gameplay experience.

- **Carrots Hiding Under Spikes:** Currently, some carrots are hidden under spikes, posing unintended challenges. This is a known issue, and we're addressing it to ensure that carrots are not concealed in areas that could impede the player's progress.
